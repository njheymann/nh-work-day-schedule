# Work Day Scheduler

## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule  
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner  
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
I WANT my schedules to be saved
SO THAT I can safely close the browser and know my schedules are still there.  


## Acceptance Criteria  
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule  
WHEN I open the work day scheduler  
THEN I am presented with a title, todays date and what day it is, and also 9 blocks with the hours 9am through to 5pm.  
WHEN I look at the blocks  
THEN I should see either a grey box (past hours), red box (current hour), green box (future hours)  
WHEN I click on the time blocks  
THEN I can input anything that I would like to schedule for that time.  
WHEN I click the save button.
THEN I will be prompted that the schedule has been saved to my localStorage.  
WHEN I refresh the page  
THEN the page reloads and my schedules are still saved in the time block that I put them in.
